            <h2>ALU87A Midnight - a surprisingly solid budget mechanical keyboard</h2>
            <div class="post-meta">21.02.2026</div>

            <p>I bought this one myself and I’ll be blunt: for <b>249 zł</b> (about 69$), the ALU87A Midnight from Dark Project gives more value than it has any right to.</p>

            <img src="../../images/blog-assets/alu87/img1.png" class="gallery-img">

            <h3>Quick summary</h3>
            <p>A heavy, metal-bodied, hot-swap TKL with doubleshot ABS keycaps (CSA profile), pre-lubed linear switches, full RGB and a surprising bundle of extras. It’s not perfect, there is no wrist rest, limited angle adjustment and the web-based Chromium-only software are annoyances - but for a first mechanical keyboard or a cheap “modder’s” board it’s excellent.</p>

            <h3>What's in the box</h3>
            <p>* Keyboard (ANSI-TKL),</p>
            <p>* Braided USB-C cable (1.8 m),</p>
            <p>* Keycap + switch puller,</p>
            <p>* 4 spare switches,</p>
            <p>* 12 spare springs and 4 spare screws,</p>
            <p>* Anti-slip feet,</p>
            <p>* Warranty card + short manual,</p>

            That accessory list is unusually generous at this price, especially the extra switches and springs. Small detail, but it matters if you like tinkering.
            </p>

            <h3>First impressions and build</h3>
            <p>Take it out of the wrapping and it feels like a proper keyboard: the aluminum case is solid (around 1.5 kg), sturdy and gives a premium impression. The keyboard is hot-swap, so swapping switches is easy, great for experimenting.</p>
            <p>Keycaps are doubleshot ABS in CSA profile (an ergonomic, sculpted profile). The layout is ANSI-TKL: compact without a numpad and with a straight, long Enter key. Some will miss the numpad, others will like the desk space saved.</p>

            <h3>Switches and sound</h3>
            <p>This unit ships with <b>G3MS Zircon Speed</b> linear switches. They arrive pre-lubed from the factory, which makes them feel smooth and subdued out of the box. They’re not the absolute quietest mechanical switches, but they produce a low, pleasant thocky sound rather than a sharp click. During faster typing you still get a satisfying rhythmic tap that’s not hurting your ears.</p>
            <p>If you like to mod keyboards later, the hot-swap socket plus included springs make it an easy starting point.</p>

            <h3>What I didn’t like</h3>
            <p>* <b>No proper tilt adjustment.</b> You get the small rubber feet included, but there’s no substantial angle adjustment like flip-out legs of different heights. For some people that’s a dealbreaker.</p>
            <p>* <b>Software is browser-only and Chromium-centric.</b> If you use Firefox, the manufacturer’s web app won’t work, because it relies on Chromium. Desktop app or wider browser support would be better.</p>
            <P>* <b>No wrist rest.</b> Basic, but a padded wrist rest would improve long sessions.</p>
            <p>* <b>Large keys feel stiff at first.</b> Shift, Enter and Backspace required more force initially; they softened up a bit after some use. Could be a QC variance, but something to be aware of.</p>
